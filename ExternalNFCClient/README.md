# Basic client app

This simple demonstration application keeps track of the service, reader and tag states. It can also start and stop the service. 
## Desfire EV1 targets
The app sends a simple command to Desfire EV1 targets, extracting some basic information about the tag.

## Host Card Emulation targets
The app also interacts with the [Host Card Emulation client app](https://github.com/skjolber/external-nfc-api/tree/master/ExternalNFCHostCardEmulationClient).
